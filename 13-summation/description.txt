Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. 
The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, 
what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

Clear Desctiption:

The task is asking you to write a program or function that takes a positive integer num as input and calculates the summation of every number from 1 to num. The result should be the sum of all these numbers.

For example, if the input is 2, the program should calculate the sum of 1 + 2, which is 3. If the input is 8, the program should calculate the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8, which is 36.

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate the expected behavior:

Input: 2
Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

Input: 8
Output: 36 (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36)
